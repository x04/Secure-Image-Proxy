A simple and secure image proxy. This can be hosted on a server that is DDoS protected and proxy images to websites that have things such as avatars in which people might try to use image IP loggers.

Usage:
http://yourserver.com/img_proxy.php?url=http://example.com/image.png

For even better security, you can serve it through SSL.
